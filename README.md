# Asana Darkness
A somewhat convoluted but highly usable stylesheet for Asana, to turn the lights down significantly. Since Asana has shown zero interest in implementing this themselves, I've been maintaining my own for years now. If you notice anything that bugs you or needs fixing, submit an issue and I'll do my best to take care of it.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING üòÑÔ∏è
I created this theme with a severe lack of understanding of most CSS, but I hacked at it long enough to where it's usable for how I personally use Asana, so...

If you like it, cool! Feel free to use it and or make it way better, but you're probably better off using the default Asana CSS, because this code has been clumsily cobbled together.

It works for me, though!
